 What is the difference between equals method and == operator in java? And what will be the output of the
following code snippets and giving proper explanation.
Code snippet 1 >
String s1 = new String("abc");
String s2 = new String("abc");
System.out.println(s1.equals(s2));
Code snippet 2 >
StringBuilder sb1 = new StringBuilder("abc");
StringBuilder sb2 = new StringBuilder("abc");
System.out.println(sb1.equals(sb2));
Code snippet 3 >
String s1 = new String("abc");
String s2 = new String("abc");
System.out.println(s1==s2);



Ans:
diffrence between equals and "==" operator is that equals() method is used for comparing 
content type of things like (String) where as "==" operator is used for comparing reference point
i.e.comparing their location. 

1.By Using equals() Method
The equals() method compares the original content of the string. It compares values of string for
equality. String class provides the following two methods:

2. By Using == operator
Day5: String, Array, CLA, Scanner 8
The == operator compares references not values.

2. By Using == operator
Day5: String, Array, CLA, Scanner 8
The == operator compares references not values.


Snippets:-

1.in snippet 1 the code will return "true" becouse we are comparing 2 "String values"  same value("abc") 
using equals method thus is is just comparing by value and in this case both are same so the answer is "true".

2.in snippet 2 the code will return "false" becouse StringBuilder does not have equals method even though we are
comparing same values the answer will be "false" . but if we change StrungBuilder to String and then compare it will return "true"

3.in snippet 3 the code  will return "false" becouse we are using "==" operator their which is not comparing their value but  is comparing thier 
reference point/location.
