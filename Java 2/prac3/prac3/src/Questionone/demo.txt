Q1) Is there any difference between creating a string with and without a new operator?  
Explain with an example.
Ans :
There are two ways to create a String object in Java: 
1. By string literal:
         String s = “Pallu”; 
2. By new keyword:
        String s = new String (” Pallu”); 
        
        
1.	By string literal: 
  Java String literal is created by using double-quotes. 
  
For Example: 
String s="Pallu"; 
In Java, the JVM maintains a string pool to store all of its strings inside the memory. The string pool helps in reusing the strings. 
Here, we are directly providing the value “Pallu”. Hence, the compiler first checks the string pool to see if this string already exists. 
   a) If this string already exists, the new string is not created. Instead, the new reference points to the already existing string “Pallu”. 
   b) If the string doesn't exist, the new string “Welcome” is created inside this string pool area. 


example 

String s1 = "Pallu"; 
String s2 = "Pallu"; 
if(s1 == s2)
       System.out.println("same"); 
else 
       System.out.println("not same"); 

       
output : same


2.	By new keyword: 

String s1 = new String("Pallu"); 
Here the value of the string is not directly provided, hence a new “Pallu” string is created inside 
the heap memory even though the “Pallu” string object is already present inside the string pool area.

 Example:
 
 String s1 = new String("Pallu"); 
String s2 = new String("Pallu"); 
if(s1 == s2) 
       System.out.println("same"); 
else 
       System.out.println("not same");
       
       
 
 output: not same
