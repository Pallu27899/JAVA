Explain Why Java is Platform independent?

Ans 
java is platform independent and object oriented programming language similar to c++
with some advancement in feature and simplification is use. 

java is platform independent because it is different from other languages like c,c++,etc. 
which are compiled into platform specific machines while java is a write once, run
anywhere language. A platform is the hardware or software environment in which a program runs 

There are two types of platforms software-based and hardware-based. Java provides a software-based platform.

The Java platform differs from most other platforms in the sense that it is a software-based platform that runs on top of other hardware-based platforms. 
It has two components:

Runtime Environment
API(Application Programming Interface)

Java code can be executed on multiple platforms, for example, Windows, Linux, Sun Solaris, Mac/OS, etc. Java code is compiled by the compiler 
and converted into bytecode. This bytecode is a platform-independent code because it can be run on multiple platforms, 
i.e., Write Once and Run Anywhere (WORA).
