Q1) Explain Type casting and its types with examples?

Ans : The process of converting data from one data type to another data type is called as "Type
      Casting".
      There are two types of primitive data types type castings.
      1. Implicit Type Casting
      2. Explicit Type Casting

      1. Implicit Type Casting:
      The process of converting data from lower data type to higher data type is called as
      Implicit Type Casting.
      example :
      byte b=10;
      int i = b;
      System.out.println(b+" "+i);

      2. Explicit Type Casting:
      The process of converting data from higher data type to lower data type is called as Explicit Type
      Casting.
      To perform explicit type casting we have to use the following pattern.
      P a = (Q) b;
      (Q) â†’ Cast operator
      Where P and Q are two primitive data types, where Q must be either same as P or lower than P .
      Example :
      int i = 10;
      byte b = (byte)i;
      System.out.println(i+" "+b);
