Explain the difference between local and instance variables?
Ans:
Instance Variable :
They are defined in class but outside the body of methods.
These variables are created when an object is instantiated and are accessible to all constructors, methods, or blocks in class.
These variables are destroyed when the object is destroyed.
It can be accessed throughout the class.
They are used to reserving memory for data that the class needs and that too for the lifetime of the object.
These variables are given a default value if it is not assigned by code.
It is not compulsory to initialize instance variables before use.
It includes access modifiers such as private, public, protected, etc.

Local Variable :
They are defined as a type of variable declared within programming blocks or subroutines.
These variables are created when a block, method or constructor is started and the variable will be destroyed once it exits the block, method, or constructor.
These variables are destroyed when the constructor or method is exited.
Its access is limited to the method in which it is declared.
They are used to decreasing dependencies between components I.e., the complexity of code is decreased.
These variables do not always have some value, so there must be a value assigned by code.
It is important to initialize local variables before use.
It does not include any access modifiers such as private, public, protected, etc.
