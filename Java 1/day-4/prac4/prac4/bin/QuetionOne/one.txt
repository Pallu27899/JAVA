
Q1) Differentiate between static and non-static variables?


Ans:- A variable provides us with named storage that our programs can manipulate.
      Each variable in Java has a specific type, which determines the size and
      layout of the variable's memory; the range of values that can be stored within
      that memory; and the set of operations that can be applied to the variable.

      *Static Variable
      ==>>
      A static variable is also called a class variable and is common across the objects
      of the class and this variable can be accessed using class name as well.

     1. Access:-
                 A static variable can be accessed by static members as well as non-static
                 member functions.
     2. Sharing:-
                  A static variable acts as a global variable and is shared among all the objects
                   of the class.
     3. Memory allocation:-
                  Static variables occupies less space and memory allocation happens once.
     4. Keyword :-
                  A static variable is declared using static keyword.


      Non-Static Variable
      ==>>
      Any variable of a class which is not static is called non-static variable or an instance variable.

      1. Access:-
                 A non-static variable can not be accessed by static member functions.
      2. Sharing:-
                 A non-static variables are specific to instance object in which they are created.
      3. Memory allocation:-
                 A non-static variable may occupy more space. Memory allocation may happen at run time.
      4. Keyword:-
                 A normal variable is not required to have any special keyword.
